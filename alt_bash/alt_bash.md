For those of you who cannot install Python at work, I've included a bash
script that does more or less what the Python script does. There's a lot
of caveats you should be aware of, however.

 - Session will not persist
 - Extremely buggy, sometimes commands will not work
 - May not work with some Terminals
 - May cause sync issues if you have multiple VPN endpoints

If you are aware of the caveats and are willing to use the script, you
may find the bash script at `base.sh`. I've also populated the directory
with a sample script I used prior to the Python script. You may be able
to adapt these two to fit your needs. Good luck.
